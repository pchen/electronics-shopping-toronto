The Gorilla Store is located in the Great Hall of the Ontario Science Centre. They offer parts, tools and kits, as well as general science apparatus for children and parents to continue exploring science at home. Catering to the 10 year old market means there isn't a full line of Maker goods, but the prices are excellent and there is a good variety of staple equipment, especially in switches, motors, and  breadboard accessories.

Owned by a former Active Surplus manager, the old gorilla from Queen St is there, and it stands as a tribute to Active Surplus' legacy in the Maker community.
